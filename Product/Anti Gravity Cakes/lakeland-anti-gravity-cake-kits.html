                                        <ol>
                                            <li>Preheat the oven to 170°C/Gas 3. Line two 8” sandwich tins with baking parchment.</li>
                                            <li>Combine the flour with the baking powder in a medium bowl and set aside.</li>
                                            <li>In a large bowl, beat together the butter and sugar with an electric hand mixer until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition, and then add the vanilla extract.</li>
                                            <li>In a separate bowl, stir the Prosecco into the sour cream. Gradually add the flour and Prosecco mixtures to the creamed butter, alternating between the two and stirring until just combined. Add 2-3 drops of colouring and mix well.</li>
                                            <li>Divide the mixture equally between the lined tins and bake for 40-50 minutes, or until well risen and a skewer inserted in the middle comes out clean. Cool in the tins for 5 minutes then turn out onto a cooling rack and allow to cool completely.</li>
                                            <li>Attach the centre rod of the cake kit to the base plate.</li>
                                            <li>Sandwich the cooled cakes together using most of the Prosecco frosting, lower them down onto the rod then use the remaining frosting to spread a thin layer over the whole cake.</li>
                                            <li>Roll out the icing and place over the cake and base plate. Smooth out and trim off any excess.</li>
                                            <li>Connect the second rod to the centre rod and top off with the corner piece.</li>
                                            <li>Melt the Candy Melts according to the pack instructions and stir in the vegetable oil. Thickly coat the rods with the melted Candy Melts then build up the pearl cascade from the bottom upwards, working quickly and using the melted mixture to hold the pearls in place.</li>
                                            <li>To create the drips around the cake, trickle teaspoonfuls of the melted Candy Melts down the sides, adding pearls to each drip before the mixture sets.</li>
                                            <li>Cover the top of the cake with the remaining Candy Melts mixture and scatter pearls all over the surface.</li>
                                            <li>Arrange Gummies on top of the pearls and around the base of the cake, applying a little of either the edible silk powder or edible glitter to each one as you work.</li>
                                            <li>To finish, place a small bottle on top of the rod and attach ribbon around the base plate.</li>
                                        </ol>
                                        <p>Tip: To make your own edible pearls, mix some edible silk powder or edible glitter into a little of the icing and roll into small balls, taking care not to over-handle the icing.</p>

                                        <h4><strong>FOR THE CAKES</strong></h4>
                                        <p>175g butter, softened, plus extra for greasing</p>

                                        <p>100g plain cooking chocolate, broken into pieces</p>
                                        <p>Large chocolate Easter egg</p>
                                        <h3>INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
                                        <ol>
                                            <li>Make both halves of the large chocolate Easter egg for the top of the cake in accordance with the instructions that come with the moulds. Set the separate halves aside.</li>
                                            <li>Preheat the oven to 180°C/Gas 4. Grease a medium hemisphere cake pan with a little butter.</li>
                                            <li>In a mixing bowl, beat the butter and sugar with an electric hand mixer until light and fluffy. Gradually beat in the eggs then gently fold in the flour, baking powder and cocoa powder.</li>
                                            <li>Spoon the cake mixture into the hemisphere pan and level with the back of the spoon, then place on a baking sheet – we recommend resting the pan on a cooking ring to hold it steady. Bake for 25-30 minutes, until well risen, firm to the touch and a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean.</li>
                                            <li>Let the cake cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then trim off any excess. Turn out onto a wire rack and leave to cool completely.</li>
                                            <li>Meanwhile, secure one of the supporting rods from the Anti-Gravity Pouring Cake Kit onto the base plate with the locking nut. Lower the cooled cake gently down over the rod, curved side down, until it rests on the base.</li>
                                            <li>Place Flake bars round the base of the cake. Cover the rest of the cake in chocolate flavoured frosting, using a palette knife to smooth the top and sides. Build up layers of bars around the cake, cutting them to size to fit and pressing each gently into the frosting to hold it in place. Add enough layers to overlap the top of the cake to help hold the mini eggs in place.</li>
                                            <li>Add the corner piece from the kit to the top of the second rod, then connect the second rod to the top of the first rod.</li>
                                            <li>Cover the top of the cake with a couple of layers of chocolate mini eggs.</li>
                                            <li>Thickly coat the upright structure with chocolate frosting and build up the mini egg cascade from the bottom of the rod upwards, using the frosting to hold the eggs in place.</li>
                                            <li>Place the plain chocolate in a heatproof bowl and melt over a pan of simmering water, without allowing the base of the bowl to touch the water.</li>
                                            <li>Meanwhile, carefully cut the thinner ends of both halves of the large chocolate Easter egg in a zigzag pattern to give it a ‘cracked’ appearance, creating a large enough opening to fit over the end of the angled rod.</li>
                                            <li>Add a layer of melted chocolate to the inside of the egg to help attach it to the top of the angled rod, then paint a little melted chocolate onto the edges of the egg halves and stick them together.</li>
                                            <li>Lower the large egg over the top of the angled rod, placing it carefully so it looks as though the mini eggs are pouring out of it. Decorate the edge of the base plate with ribbon to finish.</li>
                                        </ol>

                                        <h4><strong>FOR THE CAKE</strong></h4>
                                        <p>250g butter, softened</p>
                                        <p>250g caster sugar</p>
                                        <p>4 eggs</p>
                                        <p>300g self-raising flour, sieved</p>
                                        <p>150ml natural yoghurt</p>
                                        <p>½ tsp baking powder</p>
                                        <p>100g white chocolate, finely chopped</p>
                                        <h4><strong>FOR THE ROYAL ICING</strong></h4>
                                        <p>1 egg white</p>
                                        <p>225g icing sugar, sieved</p>
                                        <h4><strong>TO DECORATE</strong></h4>
                                        <p>200g Renshaw Flower and Moulding Paste</p>
                                        <p>350g Lakeland Classic White Frosting</p>
                                        <p>Renshaw Ready-to-Roll White Icing</p>
                                        <p>1 empty 20cl prosecco or champagne bottle</p>

                                        <p>1m x 1.5cm gold ribbon</p>

                                        <h3>INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
                                        <ol>
                                            <li>Preheat the oven to 150°C/Gas 2. Grease a 23cm pushpan with Cake Release or softened butter.</li>
                                            <li>In a mixing bowl beat the butter and sugar until soft with an electric whisk. Gradually beat in the eggs, adding a spoonful of the flour between each addition. Add the yoghurt and beat for a few seconds until combined, then fold in the remaining flour, baking powder and white chocolate.</li>
                                            <li>Spoon the cake mixture into the tin, level with the back of the spoon then bake for 55-60 minutes until well risen and firm to touch. To check that the cake is cooked insert a skewer into the centre of the cake; it should come out clean. Allow the cake to stand in the tin for 10 minutes then push out and leave to cool completely on a wire rack.</li>
                                            <li>Meanwhile, make the royal icing. Whisk the egg white in a bowl until frothy then add the icing sugar a spoonful at a time, beating until the mixture is firm. Set aside.</li>
                                            <li>To make the bubbles, use your fingertips to roll all of the moulding paste into tiny balls, the largest the size of a garden pea. Place on a tray lined with parchment paper to dry.</li>
                                            <li>Slice the cake horizontally using a serrated knife. Spread half of the frosting on the flat surface of one cake and sandwich together. Add one of the rods to the base plate of the anti-gravity kit, gently lower the cake down over it then add the second rod and a corner piece. Cover the cake in the remaining frosting and use a palette knife to smooth the top and sides.</li>
                                            <li>Roll out the white icing on a flat surface lightly dusted with icing sugar until you have a 36cm circle. Make a small incision with a knife to help it fit over the rod then lower over the cake. Use your hands to smooth the top and sides then remove any excess icing with a sharp knife.</li>
                                            <li>Take the empty bottle, gently push it onto the angled rod and secure with a little of the royal icing.</li>
                                            <li>Use some more royal icing to build up a shape that resembles the flow of champagne on top of the cake. Place the remaining royal icing into a piping bag and use small beads to attach the bubbles to the rod and the surface of the cake.</li>
                                            <li>Secure two evenly spaced strips of black ribbon round your cake using royal icing, and attach the gold ribbon to the edge of the base plate.</li>
                                            <li>Dust the bubbles with Edible Silk Metallic Gold Treasure using a food-safe brush and, if desired, sprinkle some edible gold stars over the surface to finish. We chose a star decoration to top our cake off but you can add whatever finishing touches you prefer to yours.</li>
                                        </ol>
                                        <p>Tips: Placing a small amount of frosting on the cake board will help to secure the cake so that it does not move too much when being decorated. For a stronger gold colour on the bubbles, brush them 2-3 times.</p>

                                    <h3>INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>Preheat the oven to 180°C/Gas 4. Lightly grease two 15cm sandwich tins and two 20cm sandwich tins with butter. </li>
                                        <li>To make the 15cm sponges, cream the butter and sugar together in a mixing bowl until the mixture is pale and light. Gradually add the beaten eggs, mixing well between each addition, and scraping down the sides of the bowl from time to time. Add the vanilla bean paste and milk, and mix again.</li>
                                        <li>Sift the flour into the bowl and fold in until the mixture is smooth. Divide the cake mix between the 15cm sandwich tins and level with a palette knife.</li>
                                        <li>Bake in the middle of the oven for about 15 minutes, until golden and well risen. Leave to cool in the tins for 2 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
                                        <li>To make the 20cm sponges, follow steps 2 and 3 above. Divide the mixture between the 20cm sandwich tins, bake on the middle shelf for about 20-25 minutes, then cool as above.</li>
                                        <li>To make the white chocolate spears, melt the chocolate in a heatproof bowl over a pan of simmering water, making sure the base of the bowl doesn’t touch the water.</li>
                                        <li>Line a baking sheet with parchment. Pour on the melted chocolate and spread it around to make a rectangle approx. 28 x 20cm. Sprinkle with freeze-dried strawberries pieces and chill in the fridge for 15-20 minutes. </li>
                                        <li>When set, take a large straight-edged knife and cut three larger shards for the top cake, and three smaller shards for the base cake. Set aside. Any left-over chocolate can be broken into pieces and stored in an airtight container in the fridge. </li>
                                        <li>To make the meringue kisses, first preheat the oven to 120°C/Gas 1. In a clean, dry bowl, whisk the egg whites into stiff peaks using an electric hand or stand mixer. Gradually add the sugar, whisking all the time, until thick and glossy. Mix in the strawberry flavour.</li>
                                        <li>Line two baking sheets with baking parchment. Spoon the meringue mix into a piping bag fitted with a flower nozzle. Pipe 12 rosettes of meringue – some 3cm and some 4cm – onto the baking sheets and bake for 1 hour. Remove from the oven and leave to cool completely.</li>
                                        <li>For the macaroons, first preheat the oven to 160°C/Gas 3. Place two Silicone Macaroon Moulds onto baking sheets. Whizz the icing sugar and ground almonds in a food processor until very fine, then sift into a bowl.</li>
                                        <li>Whisk the egg whites in a very clean bowl until they form soft peaks. Gradually whisk in the caster sugar until thick and glossy. Gently stir in the pink colouring and strawberry flavour.</li>
                                        <li>Using a spatula, gently fold half the almond and icing sugar mixture into the egg whites. Mix well, add the remaining half and fold into the mixture until shiny and thick. Spoon into a piping bag fitted with a 1cm plain nozzle.</li>
                                        <li>Pipe small rounds of macaroon mixture into the moulds. Gently tap the baking trays on the work surface a few times to help the mixture settle. Leave to stand at room temperature for 20 minutes to form a skin, then bake for 16 minutes, or until the macaroons feel firm and are slightly raised. Leave to cool completely before removing from the moulds, or they will break. </li>
                                        <li>Add the 100g vanilla frosting to a piping bag fitted with a flower nozzle. Pipe a swirl of frosting onto half the macaroons, then top with the rest of the macaroons and give a gentle twist to bond them.</li>
                                        <li>To assemble the 20cm cake, first cut both sponges in half horizontally with a serrated knife. Fill a disposable piping bag with 700g (2 tubs) of the vanilla frosting and snip a 1cm hole from the end. Pipe a layer over one of the 20cm sponges and smooth the surface with a palette knife. Dot the frosting with 1 tbsp jam, keeping the jam 2cm away from the edges of the cake.</li>
                                        <li>Position the next sponge on top, and repeat twice more with buttercream and jam.</li>
                                        <li>Spread a thin layer of frosting over the top and sides of the layered cake with a palette knife, keeping some of the sponge visible around the sides. Chill in the fridge for 15-20 minutes to allow the frosting to set.</li>
                                        <li>Repeat steps 16 and 17 with the 15cm sponges. Using the remaining frosting, spread a thin layer over the top and sides of the layered cake, again leaving some of the sponge showing on the sides. Chill for 15 minutes.</li>
                                        <li>Meanwhile, assemble the cake frame. Connect the 3 medium rods and 1 short rod together, fix in to the centre hole of the base and blank off the other holes. Lower the 20cm cake down over the rod until it sits on the base plate.</li>
                                        <li>Add one of the white collars to the top of the rod, attach the 2 remaining short rods above it and then lower the medium platform down to rest on the collar and blank off the other holes. Lower the 15cm cake down over the rods so it sits on the medium platform.</li>
                                        <li>Using a cocktail stick, add a few dots of the pink colouring to the Renshaw fondant icing and mix well to incorporate the colour. Heat the fondant according to the instructions. Using a teaspoon, drizzle the pink fondant down the sides of both tiers of the cake, then pour a thin layer in the centre of both tiers and smooth almost to the edges.</li>
                                        <li>Decorate each tier with macaroons, chocolate shards, meringue kisses and a pink rose. Crumble a meringue and sprinkle it between the decorations with a few pieces of freeze-dried strawberry. </li>
                                    </ol>
                                    <p>Tips: Remove the top cake tier from the frame before cutting and serving. The mini meringue kisses will keep for up to 3 months if stored in a dry, airtight container. Macaroon shells will freeze well for up to 3 months. To save time, use shop-bought macaroons and meringue kisses to decorate. </p>

                                    <h3>INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>Preheat the oven to 160°C/Gas 3 and grease 2 medium hemisphere cake pans with Cake Release or softened butter. To make the cake, beat the butter until soft in a mixing bowl with an electric whisk, then add the sugar and whisk until light and fluffy. Gradually beat in the eggs, add the vanilla extract then gently fold in the flour.</li>
                                        <li>Place the cake pans on a baking sheet, using cooking rings to keep them steady, and divide the cake mix evenly between them. Bake for 45-50 minutes until the cakes are golden brown, firm to the touch and a skewer inserted in the centre comes out cleanly. Leave to stand for 10 minutes then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
                                        <li>To make the ganache, gently bring the cream to the boil in a saucepan. Place the dark chocolate into a glass bowl, pour the cream in and stir until the chocolate has melted. Beat the mixture together then place in the fridge to cool and thicken.</li>
                                        <li>To prepare the mixture for the cone, gently melt the butter and marshmallows in a large pan, stirring until the marshmallows have completely melted. Remove from the heat and set aside 3 tbsp of the mixture. Gradually add the cereal to the pan, stirring until well coated.</li>
                                        <li>To assemble the cake frame, connect the 3 medium rods and 1 short rod together, fix into the centre hole of the base and blank off the other holes. Using a small palette knife, spread the reserved marshmallow mixture thickly over the central support. Attach the medium platform to the top along with another short rod, using a collar to hold them in place.</li>
                                        <li>To make the cone, lightly coat your hands with vegetable oil and press clumps of the marshmallow mixture on to the central support, pressing down well with the back of a spoon. Once the cone is roughly formed, invert it over a small heavy bowl and carefully remove the cake frame base to make finishing off easier. Chill in the fridge for 1 hour then use a sharp knife to trim off any excess mixture and neaten the cone.</li>
                                        <li>Set a little of the ganache aside then cover the inverted cone with the remainder, using a palette knife to spread it evenly. Return the cone to the fridge for 1 hour until the ganache has hardened.</li>
                                        <li>Divide the icing into 700g, 200g and 10g blocks ready for colouring. Following the Colour Right instruction chart, add colour as required to make 700g Summer Sand icing, 200g Summer Blue icing and 10g Summer Red icing. Wrap each individually in cling film until needed.</li>
                                        <li>Make a template by wrapping a piece of baking parchment around the cone, marking out the shape and then cutting around it – it should look like a skirt. Lightly dust a flat surface with icing sugar and roll out the sand icing until it’s large enough to fit the template on top then cut to shape with a sharp knife. Score a criss-cross pattern on the icing and wrap it around the cone, trimming off any excess with a sharp knife. If desired, use a cake airbrush kit to lightly spray brown colour onto the cone to add depth of colour.</li>
                                        <li>Melt the white chocolate and, with a small palette knife, spread a layer of chocolate about 1.5cm wide around the edge of the larger end of the cone then press 100s &amp; 1000s into the chocolate. Reattach the base with the lock nut and turn the cone the right way up.</li>
                                        <li>Neaten the edges of the cooled cakes and cut two-thirds off the top of one, discarding the domed piece. Set aside 40g frosting then colour the remainder with a few drops of pink colour, swirling the icing gently with a palette knife to create a ripple effect. With the cut one on the bottom, sandwich the cakes together with a little frosting and attach them to the top platform with a little more frosting.</li>
                                        <li>Smooth pink frosting over the cake with a palette knife then, using a piping bag fitted with a star nozzle, use the remaining frosting to pipe rosettes around the base. Leave to firm up for about 1½ hours.</li>
                                        <li>Melt the remaining ganache until just runny and use a teaspoon to drizzle it down the top of the cake. Leave to set. Make a cherry out of the red icing and vanilla pod or liquorice, pipe a swirl of white frosting on top of the ganache and add the cherry.</li>
                                        <li>On a flat surface lightly dusted with icing sugar, roll out the blue icing to a 25.5cm circle, cut a 3cm hole in the centre and slice from the centre to the outside to create a collar. Attach to the base plate with a thin layer of frosting, sprinkle the soft brown sugar around the base of the cone and finish off the edge with ribbon.</li>
                                    </ol>
                                    <p>Tip: When using the Wilton® Colour Right System, we recommend mixing the colours together in a small bowl and adding to the icing with a cocktail stick to give you better control over the end result. The spare cake can be frozen and used for making trifle or truffles.</p>
